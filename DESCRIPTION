Description: Provides statistical tools for testing first-order separability in spatio-temporal point 
 processes, that is, whether the spatio-temporal intensity function can be expressed as a product 
 of spatial and temporal components. The package implements several hypothesis tests, including 
 exact and asymptotic methods for Poisson and non-Poisson processes. Methods include global 
 envelope tests, chi-squared-type statistics, and a novel Hilbert-Schmidt independence
 criterion (HSIC) test with block or pure permutations. Simulation studies and real-world 
 examples, including the 2001 UK foot-and-mouth disease outbreak and Valencia varicella 
 data, illustrate its utility. The package encompasses all simulation studies and applications 
 presented in Ghorbani et al. (2021, 2025).
